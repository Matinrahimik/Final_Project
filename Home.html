        <p class="bio-text">Dieter Rams is a German industrial designer closely associated with the consumer products
          company Braun and the Functionalist school of industrial design. Dieter Rams was born in Wiesbaden, Germany,
          in
          1932. He was strongly influenced by the presence of his grandfather who was a carpenter. Dieter Rams's early
          awards for carpentry led to him training as an architect as Germany was rebuilt in the early 1950s.</p>
